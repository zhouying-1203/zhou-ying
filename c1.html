        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At Eloheh, we believe that access to compassionate, high-quality healthcare products and services is a right—not a privilege. 
        Founded on the principle of holistic wellness and care for the whole person, Eloheh has grown from a small family-owned clinic into 
        a trusted provider of innovative healthcare solutions for individuals and families across the region.</p>

        <p><strong>Eloheh</strong> (pronounced <em>el-oh-HAY</em>) takes its name from a Cherokee word meaning "harmony" or "earth," reflecting 
        our commitment to balance—between nature and science, prevention and treatment, people and purpose.</p>

        <p>Our journey began in 2012 when our founder, <strong>Dr. Lila Thompson</strong>, a practicing physician and public health advocate, 
        recognized a growing need for integrative healthcare services that bridged clinical expertise with everyday wellness. What started as a 
        single clinic offering preventive care and health counseling soon expanded into a comprehensive healthcare brand offering:</p>
