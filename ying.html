  <h1>Profile</h1>
  <p>My name is Ying Zhou, and my English name is Zoe.
I am currently a junior majoring in Management. During my studies, I have developed a strong interest in marketing, project management, and team collaboration.
In the past, I participated in business competitions and consulting projects during high school, which helped me improve my practical skills and communication abilities.
In my free time, I enjoy reading business case studies, listening to podcasts, traveling, and photography. These hobbies keep me curious and help me see the world from different perspectives.
